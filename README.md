This folder contains scripts associated with the paper "How does the mode of evolutionary divergence affect reproductive isolation?".

First there is a short Mathematica notebook along with an associated pdf of the notebook, for those who do not have Mathematica installed. The purpose of this is to provide a proof of the variance equivalence given at the end of the Methods section entitled "Extension to an arbitrary hybrid", for which the proof on paper is rather lengthy, but only involves algebra and is straightforward in theory. The Mathematica notebook shows the equivalence per dimension, per trait, and thus omit subscripts in the notebook, as the summation afterwards is fairly straightforward. 

There are also simulation and figure scripts.
