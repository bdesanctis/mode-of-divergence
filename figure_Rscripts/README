This repository contains the simulation data and code necessary to produce and process these data that are reported in

"How does the mode of evolutionary divergence affect reproductive isolation?"

The c++ simulation code can be found in the directory "simulation_code".
Instructions for compilation can be found in the README file in that directory.

The simulation data produced with this code is stored in the "complete_sims" directory.
Each file contains the set of substitutions that fixed in a single population.

To compute the relevant statistics, the compile_sims R script was used. The result is stored in "procSim.RData". To compile the simulations for figure S1, the compile_FigS1.R script is used which creates "procSim_FigS1.RData".

"sims_param_combinations.csv" contains a list of the parameter combinations of the simulations used for these figures.
