This repository contains the code necessary to produce and process the simulation data that are reported in

"How does the mode of evolutionary divergence affect reproductive isolation?"

The c++ simulation code can be found in the directory "simulation_code".
Instructions for compilation can be found in the README file in that directory.

The simulation data produced with this code should be stored in a directory called "complete_sims".
Each file will contain the set of substitutions that fixed in a single population.

To compute the relevant statistics, the "procsim.R" script was used. The results are stored in "procSim.RData" which can be downloaded from 
doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.21843225.

To compile the simulations for figure S1, the "procsim_FigS1.R" script is used which creates "procSim_FigS1.RData".

The scripts called "makeFigX.R" will use these RData objects to create the relevant Figure.

"sims_param_combinations.csv" contains a list of the parameter combinations of the simulations used for these figures, and serves as input to the "procsim.R" script.
